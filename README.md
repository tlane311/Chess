### Introduction
This markdown was created to help myself whenever I want to alter the chess app or for anyone who is curious how it works.

### Notes
ES6 modules are used.

### React-App
#### Game Logic
Game logic is stored in app/src/components/game/pieces.


### Backend
A server is created using express and a tcp connection is set up between the server and the client via socket.io.
